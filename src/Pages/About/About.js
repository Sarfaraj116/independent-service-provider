            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am Sarfaraj Shaikat. I set a goal for my life because i need to be a good developer. I have completed my Graduation last year. In future i fixed my goal which i have to implement. </p>
            <p>Ensure and make my goals clear to help me work towards achieving them. Instead of I want to learn interpersonal skills, I can set the objective of ensuring that i interact with at least 15 fellow developers every month.</p>
            <p>Learn to set milestones in the course of the journey towards the top of my carrier. I can develop the skills and experience you feel will make your developer profession grow. Set measurement as learning and focus on gaining a new skill every month.</p>
            <p>Technical talent alone does not offer satisfaction within a team, and other qualities are needed. Finding the best team that has the same professional goals as mine is essential in achieving my goals.</p>
